    <h1>This is our dog blog!</h1>
    <p>We love our dogs. Here's a little about them.</p>

    <h2>Meet Nugget</h2>
    <p>Nugget is a chihuahua terrier mix. We got him last year at Pixie Project. He's 10 pounds, and loves to lay under blankets to stay warm.</p>

    <h2>Meet Buddha</h2>
    <p>Buddha loves her bone and hates going on walks.</p>
    <p>Her dog siblings are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bubsy</li>
        <li>Severus</li>
      </ul>
